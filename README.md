# Classifier-Model-for-Predicting-NBA-player-positions

Implemented LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Classification) model for classifying NBA players into 5 positions on the basketball court: SG(Shooting guard), PG(Point Guard), SF(Small Forward), PF(Power Forward) and C(Center). In this, we made classifications based on the players per game average performance in the 2015-2016 season. In this, the data was divided into training and test set and by using L2 Normalization and Feature selection, the accuracy of the model was increased. Achieved 64% accuracy for predicting the class for a particular player.
